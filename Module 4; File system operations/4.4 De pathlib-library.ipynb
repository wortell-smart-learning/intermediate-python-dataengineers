    "Although the functionality of `os.path` is very nice, it lacks some functionality in case you want to do some more complex operations, such as matching files of a certain structure and navigating hierarchies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In its core, it implements paths as objects, and implements a lot of the operations you can do with paths as methods of that object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some nice features of pathlib:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can construct paths using the `/` operator in python, like this:\n",
    " - `p = Path('./')`\n",
    " - `q = p / 'sour' / 'gin_sour.json'`\n",
    "- You can open files:\n",
    " - `with q.open() as file_in: json.loads(file_in.read())`\n",
    "- You can use [glob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) style pattern matching:\n",
    " - `q.glob('**/*.json')`\n"
