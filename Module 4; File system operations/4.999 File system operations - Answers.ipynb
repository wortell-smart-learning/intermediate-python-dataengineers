    "In this module we will explore the interactions between your code and the file system you're working with. We will learn to execute all operations on files you would normally do by hand, such as copying, moving, renaming, creating and deleting files or folders. This will be done in a programmatic way, making sure the implementation is generic and not os-dependant.\n",

    "Good file system operations are key to succesfully working with, storing, and moving files on a system. Using the different libraries available in Python, we can do this in a programmatic way. And what's even better, we can make sure that the implementation is not os-dependant. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several common operating systems (OS) available, such as Windows, MacOS and Linux. Every OS has its own way of file pathing and structuring directories. For example, Windows uses drives and (double) backslashes: \"C:\\Users\\Bas\" or \"C:]]Users\\\\Bas\". Linux doesn't use drives, and uses forward slashes: \"/home/Bas\". And MacOS is similar to Linux, using forward slashes: \"Users/Bas\".\n",

    "The libraries that we'll be discussing today are able to work with each OS, and thus make your code OS independent. Which is very useful!"
