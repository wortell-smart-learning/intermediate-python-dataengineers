    "As a programmer, you often check the status of the output of your code. Furthermore, it is often a good idea to check the status of variables at certain point in your code. In Python, this is often done with the function *print()*. While this is a good way of checking the status of variables or your output, it only exists in the environment (may it be a Python console, a terminal, an IDE or otherwise) you are working in. If you ever close the environment, the print statements are gone forever.\n",

    "### **Theory - why use pickle?**\n",
    "Compared to other file types, it might be unclear at this point why we want to use pickle at all. Binary files aren't easy to read or use in general. So wouldn't it be more convenient to save data as a more generic file types such as XML, JSON or CSV?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is: it depends on what type of information you want to save and/or transfer. Pickle is ment as a convenient file type to transfer **Python objects** specifically between different systems, environments or pieces of Python code. It is the fastest and most efficient way to transport practically any(!) Python object."

This is arguably the most powerful usage of Pickle for a Data Engineer when working with ML models.\n",
