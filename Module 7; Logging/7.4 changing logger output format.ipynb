    "# Section 5: changing the output format of a logger\n",
    " \n",
    "As you noticed by now, there is a default format in which a logger outputs information, which is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"%(levelname)s:%(name)s:%(message)s\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "This format is written in an ancient (i.e. Python2.7) style of string formatting, so it might be a bit hard to read, but should make sense considering you have seen the output it gives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the logger we've created automatically outputs in the console (or in the case of notebooks, the cell), and not yet stored in a file. This is because the default handler that is given to a logger is the [StreamHandler](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.StreamHandler), which sends all output to [sys.stderr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_error_(stderr)) (this basically means to the terminal, console or notebook cell you are working in).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now see how we can change the output format of the logger. This is done in multiple steps: \n",
    "* create a handler (we will use a SteamHandler for now)\n",
    "* create a new format as a string\n",
    "* add the format to the handler\n",
    "* add the handler to the logger we created\n",
    "\n",
