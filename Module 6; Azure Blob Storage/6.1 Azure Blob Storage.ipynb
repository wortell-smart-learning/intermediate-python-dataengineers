    "### Section 1: What is Azure Blob Storage? (15 min)\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure Blob Storage is an online place where data can be stored, it's as simple as that. And as with almost any data storage location, there is a way to let Python do the heavy lifting for us. There are options and libraries within Python that will allow to communicatie with this way of data storage, and retrieve information from the stored data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure Blob Storage is a storage solution for the cloud, and is optimized for storing huge amounts of unstructured data. The unstructured data is data that usually doesn't follow a data model. Examples are text data, images or videos. This makes Azure Blob Storage an ideal place where to quickly store and access your (unstructured) data.\n",
    "\n",
    "One can view Azure Blob Storage as a file system, with a hierarchical relationship in storing the data or files. When data is stored within the Azure Blob Storage, you can access it using the Azure Blob Storage REST API, which we'll look at further on.\n",
    "The structure of Azure Blob Storage is described in the image below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![blob1.png](attachment:blob1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the image above, you can see three important things. The storage account, the containers within the storage account, and the blob within the containers. These are the core of what makes up Azure Blob Storage. Let's have a look at each of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The storage account**\n",
    "A storage account provides a unique namespace in Azure for your data, it creates a space to store your objects and allows you to find those objects again. Every object that you store in Azure Storage has an address that includes your unique account name. The combination of the account name and the Blob Storage endpoint forms the base address for the objects in your storage account. For example, if your storage account is named newstorageaccount, then the default endpoint for Blob storage is: http://newstorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net\n",
    "\n",
    "**Containers**\n",
    "A container organizes a set of blobs, similar to a directory works in a file system. A storage account can include an unlimited number of containers, and a container can store an unlimited number of blobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Blobs**\n",
    "Blobs are the lowest tier within Azure Blob Storage. They are the files that you store within your Blob storage. There are three different types of blobs; Block blobs, Append blobs, and Page blobs. In this training we will only be using the blocks blobs. For now, all you need to know about the different blob types, is that they exists, and that each of them will have a different functionality. See their documentation for more information (if you want): https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-pageblob-overview?tabs=dotnet.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With this as a core, we can move to working with Azure Blob Storage. And as with every data-related subject, we can use Python. During this training we will start with a focus on the following core aspects:\n",
    "- Create a container.\n",
    "- Upload a file to block blob.\n",
    "- List blobs.\n",
    "- Download a blob to file.\n",
    "- Delete a blob.\n",
    "- Delete the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "And afterwards, we will put these core practices more into practice, so that it all becomes familiar."

    "### Section 2: Connecting with Azure Blob Storage (45 min)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing that we'll have to do, is to be able to connect to the Azure Blob Storage. As mentioned above, each Blob Storage has its own unique endpoint. Along with that, there are also unique keys to authenticate the one trying to access the Blob Storage. \n",
    "\n",
    "As with a lot of things, there is a Python library that we can use. We are going to make use of the azure-blob-storage library. See the documentation for more information: https://pypi.org/project/azure-storage-blob/. This library is designed to help with operations on an Azure Blob Storage. It will allow to make a connection to the Blob Storage, and to retrieve information in that Blob Storage, and also perform other actions such as creating your own containers and storing your own data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first have a look at making a connection. There are multiple possibilities on how to do that (as you could have seem in the documentation). We are going to focus on one of them for now.\n",

    "Let's analyse the code above. The first thing of note is the variable 'CONNECTION_STRING'. This is one of the methods that can be used to access an Azure Blob Storage. When you read the 'CONNECTION_STRING', you can see the storage account name, the account key, and the endpoint. \n",
    "Another aspect is the usage of the BlobClient. This comes from the azure-storage-blob library. In using it, you have to use the connection-string, the name of the container, and sometimes the name of the blob. In this particular example we retrieved only one blob, which is a single json-file. Using the json library, we can retrieve the answer.\n",
